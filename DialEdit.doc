The Capabilities section briefly describes the main capabilities
of the Dialog Editor.

The General Operations section begins by defining basic concepts 
(terminology subsection).  The remaining subsections describe the 
general processes of designing a dialog.  The General Operations 
section provides details of generic operations that apply to all 
dialog components.  (Thus, these details do not need to be re- 
peated in the Object Dialogs section, which describes operations
for individual dialog components.)

The Main Screen / Main Commands section provides an overview of
the main commands, available via the Menu Bar (pull-down menus),
the Status Line, or the keyboard.

The File Commands section describes the commands available from
the File menu.

The Dialog Commands section describes the commands available from
the Dialog menu.

The General Editing Features section describes features that are
common to most or all of the edit dialogs described later.

The Dialog Dialogs and Component Dialog sections describe the
dialogs used to create and edit dialogs and dialog components.
The order of presentation of the dialog components is from the
simplest to the most complex.  In general, for most objects there
is a 'new object' command that executes a 'new object' dialog to
create and initially define the object.  Double-clicking the ob-
ject executes a similar 'change object' dialog to modify it.
These dialogs handle all of the object features except position
and size, which are handled by dragging operations described in
the General Operation section.

The Notes section provides some advice on use of Turbo Vision ob-
jects, and clarifications of Borland documentation.

Capabilities ====================================================

The Dialog Editor provides a means to create and edit Turbo
Vision dialogs and similar windows.  The layout and visual
appearance of these are easily changed by moving and re-sizing
the component parts on the screen.  The dialogs (or windows) can
be saved in a file and retrieved later, and Pascal code can be
generated to initialize the dialogs and to describe the associat-
ed data records.

The Dialog Editor can be installed in the Tools menu of the Bor-
land Pascal IDE, where the Pascal Code can be copied into a pro-
gram and customized or integrated as needed.  Dialog components
may include any of these objects: StaticText, ParamText, Button,
InputLine (with optional standard Validator and optional History 
-- only the History icon is visible), RadioButtons, CheckBoxes, 
MultiCheckBoxes, and ListBox.  Many of these can have an assoc- 
iated Label object, and the ListBox has an associated vertical
ScrollBar object.  See sample dialog above.

String data appearing in edit dialogs are saved in a history buf- 
fer and history file, allowing previous used data to be retrieved 
and reused.  The default data in edit dialogs can be redefined 
(also saved in the history file).  These features, with vari- 
ations, can be used to copy and paste object definition data.

General Operation ===============================================

Terminology -----------------------------------------------------

The dialog currently being designed and shown on the screen is 
called the 'trial dialog', and its components are called 'trial 
objects', such as trial buttons, trial input lines, etc.  Al- 
though it looks like a real dialog, it is not executed -- it is 
just displayed and edited.  Only one trial dialog is shown on the 
screen at a time, but any dialog can be saved in a 'dialog col- 
lection' file.

Pascal code can be generated from a trial dialog, and the gener- 
ated code inserted into your program.  The dialog created by the 
generated code, and its component objects, are called 'real' 
objects.  The 'real' component objects are standard Turbo Vision 
objects.

The trial objects shown by the Dialog Editor look like the real 
objects, with minor exceptions.  For example, the trial dialog 
has a resize corner; the real one does not.  Also, the trial
objects behave differently than the real objects.  For example,
trial Buttons can be moved and re-sized, but can't be pressed.
The Dialog Editor actually displays a descendant of TButton
called TTrialButton, and uses this to generate Pascal code for a
TButton.  (When we capitalize an object name it refers to a
standard Turbo Vision object.)

We will call trial Labels, History icons, and Scrollbars 'sec- 
ondary' objects, because they are always 'attached' to, or 
associated with, one of the other types of dialog components, 
which we will call 'primary' objects.  (See the sample dialog 
above for examples.)

There are other secondary objects that are never visible in a 
trial dialog: four standard types of Validator objects, and the
HistoryWindow and HistoryViewer objects.  These are optionally
attached to, or associated with, InputLine objects.  In a real
dialog, the Validator objects are also invisible, but show a
visible MessageBox if an attempt is made to shift the focus from
an InputLine with invalid data.  The HistoryWindow and History-
Viewer objects are associated with History icons attached to
InputLines.  (See Borland documentation for further details.)

For each primary object and any associated secondary objects, and 
also for the trial dialog window, there is an 'edit' dialog with
two variations to create and edit the primary object and to add
or remove secondary objects, as applicable.  In all, are four
means of editing an object:

    (1) a 'new object' dialog to create/define the object(s),
    (2) dragging operations to move/resize the object(s),
    (3) a 'change object' dialog to modify the object.
    (4) testing the trial dialog, which changes the displayed
        data values.  Source code for a data record with these
        values can be generated.

The 'new object' and 'change object' variations of the edit 
dialog for each primary object are very similar.  For example, 
the 'Change InputLine' dialog is just like the 'New InputLine'
dialog, except for two additional buttons.

In summary, 'edit' dialogs are used to create and edit a 'trial' 
dialog, which looks like the 'real' dialog that you want to in- 
clude in your program.  Source code is generated to insert into 
your program, and to edit further, if needed.  When your program 
runs, the 'real' dialog appears and executes.

In case you need to redo this development cycle, you should save
the trial dialog in a dialog collection file.  This is a resource
file of trial dialogs that can be fetched, edited, and translated
to source code again.  It should not be confused with a resource
file of real dialogs, which is an alternative representation of
the object initialization code of a program.

Creating Objects ------------------------------------------------

To begin a Dialog design, a new trial Dialog is created by the 
'New Dialog' command, which executes a 'New Dialog' dialog (de- 
tailed later).  Unlike a normal dialog, the trial Dialog has a
resize corner, and can be resized. But the Pascal code generated
for the corresponding 'real' dialog is normal (not resizable),
and its Bounds will correspond to the current position and size
of the trial dialog.

For each primary object to be inserted into the trial Dialog, 
there is a 'new object' command which executes a 'new object' 
dialog, such as 'New Button', 'New InputLine', etc.  The 'new 
object' dialogs allow specification of visible features (such as
the text on a Button) and invisible features (such as the name of
the command that the Button will generate).

Moving / Resizing Objects ---------------------------------------

A 'new object' dialog does not specify the size or position of 
the object.  The new object is initially inserted with a default 
size at the bottom right of the trial Dialog.  The new object can 
then be dragged to the desired position (with the left mouse but- 
ton) and dragged to the desired size (with the right mouse but- 
ton).  For either type of dragging, it is only necessary to place
the mouse initially any place on the object.  Every object has a
minimum size, and cannot grow bigger than the space inside the
frame of the trial dialog.  If the trial dialog is not big enough 
to accommodate the new component, or too big, its resize corner 
(bottom right) can be dragged to change its size.

Secondary objects generally move automatically, as follows.  An 
example is a Label associated with an InputLine.  When the pri- 
mary object (the InputLine) is moved, the secondary object (the
Label) will automatically move (when dragging stops) the same
amount, maintaining its position relative to the primary object.
But when the secondary object is moved, the primary object does
not move, thus re-defining the relative positioning.  Labels
follow the top left corner of their primary object.  The vertical 
Scrollbar of a ListBox follows either the left or right side of 
the ListBox (the nearest side), and follows both the vertical 
position and vertical size of the ListBox.  History icons cannot 
be dragged separately, but follow the associated InputLine.

Changing / Deleting Objects -------------------------------------

Double-clicking on any trial object executes a 'change object' 
dialog, which is similar to the 'new object' dialog, thus allow- 
ing any feature to be changed.  The 'change object' dialogs also 
provide for deletion of dialog components and for changing the 
'Z-order' of the components.  Details are given in the "Change 
Object Dialogs" section.

The Dialog | Test function can be used to change the data shown 
by the dialog.  Although this data is saved and retrieved as part 
of the trial dialog, it is not part of the real dialog defin- 
ition, but rather defines the data record transferred to and from 
the dialog (by the SetData and GetData methods) when it is exe- 
cuted.

Saving / Retrieving / Coding Dialogs ----------------------------

The trial dialog can be saved in a 'dialog collection' file.  
This is actually a resource file, but cannot be used as a re- 
source file for your program, because the objects in it are 
'trial' objects, not 'real' objects, with differences as noted 
above.  But the dialog collection file is useful for retrieving 
previous dialog designs.  Pascal code can be generated for the 
current dialog, which includes an Init constructor for creating 
the dialog, and a declaration of a record type associated with 
the GetData and SetData methods of the dialog.

Given that the dialog was named GadgetDialog, the generated code
would include the following (the 'const' part is optional):

    type
        PGadgetDialog = ^TGadgetDialog;
        TGadgetDialog = object(TDialog)
            constructor Init;
        end;

        PGadgetData = ^TGadgetData;
        TGadgetData = record
            {definition of data field names and types}
        end;

    const
        GadgetDefaults: TGadgetData = (
            {definition of default data values}
        );

The easiest way to use the dialog is to use the ExecuteDialog
function of the App unit.  A typical use of the dialog would be:

    procedure ExecuteGadgetDialog;
    var
        GadgetData: TGadgetData;
    begin
        with GadgetData do begin
            { set values of GadgetData fields }
            if Application^.ExecuteDialog(
                New(PGadgetDialog, Init, @GadgetData
            ) <> cmCancel
            then begin
                { act on new values of GadgetData fields }
            end;
        end;
    end;

The GadgetData variable might need to be global.  If the constant 
GadgetDefaults is defined, then GadgetData can be easily init- 
ialized by the statement:

            GadgetData:= GadgetDefaults;

If the dialog uses more buttons than the usual Ok and Cancel but- 
tons, the 'then' clause of the 'if' statement might need to in- 
clude a 'case' statement to provide actions for each button 
(except Cancel).  (The standard commands cmOk, cmCancel, cmYes, 
and cmNo, which are normally associated with TButton objects, 
terminate execution of a TDialog, and are returned by the 
ExecuteDialog function.  If other commands are used, generally 
the descendant dialog must override the HandleEvent method.)

Using History Icons (ÞÝ) ---------------------------------------

Most of the input lines of the dialogs for editing objects and
changing options have history icons.  (A history icon is a small
down-arrow at the right end of an input line.)  Clicking on a
history icon opens a small history window that lists previous
string values of the associated input line and other input lines
with a similar function.  (See Borland documentation for more
details.)  The history windows can be used to restore old string
values, or to copy-and-paste string data from one input line to
another.

The history data is read from the default history file when the
program starts, and written to the history file when the program
exits.  The 'Options' section below describes how to specify the
history file.

Main Screen / Main Commands =====================================

Menu Bar --------------------------------------------------------

The Dialog Editor has a menu bar at the top of the screen with
these items on the left side:

±±Dialog_Editor±±±File±±Dialog±±New±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±

Each of the menu items on the menu bar can be activated by click- 
ing or dragging with the mouse, or by typing the highlighted let- 
ter with the ALT key down.  Menu items can also be selected with
the F10 key and arrow keys.  Any menu item can be cancelled with
the ESC key or by clicking at another position.  Menu items shown 
in gray are not currently selectable.

Once a menu is 'pulled down', items can be selected and activated
by clicking with the mouse, or by typing the highlighted letter,
or selecting with the arrow keys and activating with the Enter
key.

At the right end of the menu bar is a Swap control, an Edit Mode
control ('Default' or 'Paste'), and a clock display, such as:

                  ±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±Swap±±Default±±12:20:39±

The Swap control provides quick switching between two dialogs.
Operation of the Swap control is explained in the section
"Special Controls".

The Edit Mode display indicates whether dialogs for creating new
objects will be initialized with default data or with data from a
paste buffer.  Operation of the Edit Mode control is explained in
the section "Special Controls" and in the section "New Object
Dialogs".

The clock display is in hour:minutes:seconds format.

Activating the 'Dialog Editor' menu item shows a copyright notice
with the date of the current version of the Dialog Editor:

In this and other menus, an elipsis (..) indicates that action is
not immediate, but that a dialog is executed next, allowing for
choices and possible cancellation before committing to action.

Each of these items is explained in detail in the section 'File
Commands' below.  Briefly, these commands do the following:

Output options..  setup and output pictures and/or code.
Select files..    select files used by the Dialog Editor.
Change dir..      change the DOS default (current) directory.
DOS shell         go temporarily to DOS.
Exit              quit the Dialog Editor.

The Output command can combine the functions of the Gen Code and
Picture commands (next), and can process a list of selected
dialogs at one command.

Activating one of these items executes a dialog box to create the 
named Turbo Vision object.  These dialogs are explained in the 
section 'Object Dialogs' below.  For each object, there is a 'New 
Object' dialog to create the object, and a similar 'Change Ob- 
ject' dialog to edit the object.

Status Line -----------------------------------------------------

The Dialog Editor has a 'status' line at the bottom of the screen
with these items, explained next:

±Exit±±Dilg±±StTxt±±ParTxt±±Butn±±InpLn±±RdBtns±±ChkBxs±±MltBxs±±
                              .. (continued) .. ±±LstBx±±±340416±

At the end of the status line is a display of the number of bytes
of available memory, such as shown above.

The Exit item is equivalent to the Exit command in the File menu.
The other items are equivalent to the commands in the New menu,
as follows:

This dialog sets up various options before picking out (with an- 
other dialog) which dialogs in the collection file will be trans- 
lated to picture form and/or Turbo Vision source code and sent to
the Code Output (file or standard output).

Selecting Pictures will generate text pictures of the selected
dialogs, such as those used in this documentation.  Selecting TV
Code will generate Pascal code for each selected dialog declaring 
an object type for the dialog, a record type for the associated
data, and providing an Init constructor.  At least one of these
must be checked, or there will be nothing to do.

Generated Pascal code will include a definition of default data
values for each dialog for which the 'Gen. Defaults' option was
selected by the 'New Dialog' or 'Change Dialog' dialogs.  (See
the 'Creating a Trial Dialog' and 'Editing the Trial Dialog'
sections.)

If both Pictures and TV Code are checked, the pictures are en- 
closed in (* *) comment delimiters. The sequence will be pictures
for all selected dialogs, declarations for all selected dialogs,
and Init constructors for all selected dialogs.

The Show.. and Pattern of.. options specify how Pictures are to
be generated, and the Code Format and Indent.. options specify
how TV Code is to be generated.

If the Unit Code Format is selected, additional syntax is in- 
cluded as needed to make the output file a compilable unit.

The Indent item is a MultiCheckBox with values represented by the
symbols 1234T, which specify how the source code and/or pictures
will be indented.  A digit specifies that number of spaces for
each level of indentation, and a T indicates that a tab character
will be used for each level.  (Pictures are indented one level.)
Use the space bar or mouse clicks to change the selection.

The Show checkboxes indicate whether the Dialog (or Window)
frames will include a resize corner, and whether a shadow will be
included in each picture.

The 'Pattern of' MultiCheckBoxes select shade characters for the
background and for the shadow (if any) of the Dialog (or Window).

Checking the Save checkbox causes all of dialog selections to be 
saved in the History file as new default values (unless the dia- 
log is cancelled).  This does not change the default value of the
Save checkbox however.

Pressing the Pick button activates the next dialog:

If you only wanted to set Picture and TV Code options (and per-
haps also change the defaults of these) without producing any
output now, you can cancel this dialog or click Ok without
selecting any dialogs.

The ListBox displays a list of dialogs that are stored in the
current dialog collection file.  (The captions 'space toggles û'
and 'go gen' are reminders that this dialog operates differently
than a similar dialog titled 'Fetch Dialog', which selects only 
one dialog.)  Use the up and down arrow keys or the mouse to move 
the highlight, then press the space bar to add or remove a check 
mark (û) to the dialog name.

After check-marking as many dialog names as you like, clicking Ok
or pressing the Enter key will cause the selected dialogs to be
fetched from the collection file and processed according to the
Output Options dialog, generating picture and/or code output.

If pictures are included, the dialogs will be briefly put on the
screen.  But if there is already a trial dialog on-screen with
edit changes that were not saved, a MessageBox will appear asking
if you want to save it.  If it has no unsaved changes, it will be
removed from the screen without asking.

Multiple output operations will append data to the output file, 
because the output file is not closed until the output filename 
is changed or the Dialog Editor exits.  This doesn't make sense 
if you have selected the Unit Code Format option.  If you want to 
output multiple unit files you must change the output name be- 
tween output operations.

The output file is opened when first used, and any existing file
will be overwritten at this time.

The InputLine labelled 'Collection File Name' specifies the file- 
name of the dialog collection file.  The 'Code Output Name' In- 
putLine specifies the filename of the file to receive pictures
and/or Pascal code generated for trial dialogs, but an empty
string indicates that the standard output is to be used.  The
'History File Name' InputLine specifies the name of the file used
to save history data (see the 'Using History Icons' section
above).  The file names follow DOS conventions and may include
drive and path specifications.

For the Collection and Code file names, if the file name is
changed, the old file will be closed if open.  The new file is
not opened until first used.

If the History file name is changed, the current history data 
will be written to the old file, then history data read from the
new file if it already exists.  The history file is also read
when the program starts, and written when the program exits.

If the Dialog Editor is installed in the Tools menu of the IDE, 
use the $SAVE ALL $CAP EDIT macros in the IDE setup, and use the 
default standard output option of the Dialog Editor.  The stan- 
dard output will be directed to a Transfer Output window.  From
this window, the generated code can be copied and pasted into a
program source file, or the Transfer Output window can be Saved 
As a file.

These options can also be set with parameters on the DOS command
line.  The general syntax is:

    dialedit [ /cCollFile ] [ /oCodeFile ] [ /hHistFile ]

Optionally, the filenames can be separated from the option codes
by spaces.  The default options can also be set 'permanently' (by
modifying the dialedit.exe file) with the CONFIG program.  The
syntax is similar:

    config dialedit [ /cCollFile ] [ /oCodeFile ] [ /hHistFile ]

Change Dir ------------------------------------------------------

This command executes the ChDirDialog (change directory) dialog
from the StdDlg unit, which displays a directory tree for the
current drive, and allows you to select any drive/directory as
'current'.  (See Turbo Vision documentation.)

DOS Shell -------------------------------------------------------

This command executes a copy of the DOS command interpreter, with
limited memory.  Type 'exit' at the DOS prompt to return to the
Dialog Editor.

Exit ------------------------------------------------------------

This command returns control to the operating system from which
the Dialog Editor was started.

Dialog Commands =================================================

Here, we provide more details of the commands available from the
Dialogs menu.

Save ------------------------------------------------------------

The dialog collection file is the file named by the File / Select 
command described above.  If such a file does not exist, a new 
file will be created.  The name assigned to identify the trial 
dialog to be saved in the file is the concatenation of the Base- 
Name and TypeName fields as assigned to the trial dialog by the
'New Dialog' or 'Change Dialog' dialog.  If a dialog specified by
this name already exists in the file, it will be replaced.  If
needed, use the Fetch Dialog command to review existing dialog
names, and use the 'Change Dialog' dialog to change the name of a
trial dialog before saving it.

Delete ----------------------------------------------------------

This command deletes the current trial dialog from the dialog
collection file, after confirming the action with a MessageBox
naming the dialog.  To delete any other dialog, first use the
Fetch Dialog command to select the dialog.  (This allows you to
see the dialog that you are deleting.)

Fetch -----------------------------------------------------------

This command executes a dialog box like this, showing the names
of dialogs (if any) in the current dialog collection file.  This
command does nothing if there is no dialog collection file.

        ÈÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¼

Select a dialog name by clicking it with the mouse (or using
arrow keys) and then click the Ok button (or use Enter key) to
fetch the selected dialog.  The fetched dialog is displayed as
the current trial dialog, and can be edited, or code generated
for it.  If there is a trial dialog on the screen before the
Fetch Dialog command is executed, which was modified but not
saved, a message box will appear asking if you want to save it.
Else, the fetched dialog will replace the current trial dialog,
because the Dialog Editor will not show more than one trial
dialog at a time.

Click the Cancel button (or use ESC key) if you just wanted to
see the dialog names.

Gen Code --------------------------------------------------------

This command uses the options set by the File | Output Options 
command, and the code output file (or standard output) as spec- 
ified by the File | Select Files command.

Pascal code is generated (but no picture) for the trial dialog
currently shown on the screen (if any), as described for the File
| Output Options command.

Picture ---------------------------------------------------------


This command uses the options set by the File | Output Options 
command, and the code output file (or standard output) as spec- 
ified by the File | Select Files command.

A picture is generated (but no Pascal code) for the trial dialog
currently shown on the screen (if any), as described for the File
| Output Options command.

Test ------------------------------------------------------------

This command creates a real dialog from the trial dialog, which 
you can test.  Initial data values are copied from the trial dia- 
log.  To copy the data values from the real dialog back to the 
trial dialog, you must press an 'Ok' button, which means that the 
dialog must have an 'Ok' Button.  (Actually, it's the cmOk com- 
mand that matters, not the Button text.)  Pressing buttons that
generate cmCancel, cmYes, or cmNo commands will also terminate
the dialog, but do not save the data.

Data transferred to the trial dialog in this manner can be saved
in the dialog collection file, and can be used to generate code
for a default data record.

The real dialog temporarily created by this command slightly dif- 
fers from the real dialog created by the generated code, as fol- 
lows.  (1) Validators are not activated.  (2) ListBoxes do not
have a list.  (3) ParamText objects have nil, null, or zero data 
values.  For (2) and (3), you will need to connect the generated 
code to data sources that you specify.

General Editing Features ========================================

Special Controls ------------------------------------------------
(and an overview of copy-and-paste operations)

The Swap control provides quick switching between the last two 
trial dialogs that have been saved or fetched.  Clicking on the 
'Swap' word on the menu bar activates this function if two such 
dialogs exist (two dialog names are remembered).  Deleting a dia- 
log will disable this feature until another dialog is fetched or 
a new one is created and saved.

Activating the Swap function automatically saves the current 
trial dialog (if any) and fetches the previous trial dialog.  Re- 
peating the Swap function switches between the same two dialogs 
(until another dialog is fetched or a new one is created and 
saved).  This is convenient when copying and pasting objects from 
one dialog to another.

The Edit Mode display indicates whether dialogs for creating new 
objects will be initialized with default data or with data from a 
paste buffer.  Clicking on the Edit Mode display toggles the 
mode.  The mode is also set by buttons appearing in an edit dia- 
log.  The initial mode is Default.

As an example, suppose we want to copy a CheckBoxes object from
an existing 'Old' dialog to a 'New' dialog.  This will provide an
overview of copy-and-paste operations, as well as illustrate the
use of the Swap and Edit Mode controls.

First we create dialog 'New', then fetch dialog 'Old'.  But be- 
fore we actually get dialog 'Old', we are prompted "Save current 
dialog?" and we answer "Yes".  The editor then saves dialog 'New' 
and fetches dialog 'Old'.  We double-click the CheckBoxes object 
in dialog 'New', which brings up a 'Change CheckBoxes' dialog.  
We click the 'Copy' button in this dialog to copy the CheckBoxes 
specifi- cations into a Paste buffer, and the Edit Mode is auto- 
matically changed to Paste.  We click on the Swap control, and we 
switch back to dialog 'New'.  We click on 'ChkBxs' at the bottom 
of the screen, and get a 'New CheckBoxes' dialog which shows the 
speci- fications from the Paste buffer.  (We can change the 
CheckBoxes specifications at this point if we like.)  We click 
the Ok button, and the imported CheckBoxes appear in dialog 
'New'.  We then drag the CheckBoxes to the desired location, and 
perhaps also resize it.  (If the CheckBoxes object had an at- 
tached Label object, the Label and its relative position would 
also be copied automatically.)

Swapping again, we can go back to dialog 'New' to copy more ob- 
jects.  But since the Dialog Editor reserves a separate space in 
the Paste buffer for each type of object, we can copy-and-paste
one of each type of object from one dialog to another in each
Swap cycle.  If we needed to copy most of the dialog, it would be 
easier to start by copying the entire dialog -- by changing the 
name of the dialog and saving it with the new name.

When done copying and pasting, we generally would want to click 
the Edit Mode control, toggling it to 'Default' mode, to be pre- 
pared to create objects.  The 'New Object' dialogs will now start 
with default data instead of data from the Paste buffer.

'New Object' Dialogs --------------------------------------------

When execution of a 'new object' dialog begins, the dialog data
are initialized either from a 'Default' buffer or from a 'Paste'
buffer, depending on the current state of the 'edit buffer mode'.
We will explain all these new terms next.

The 'dialog data' are the values shown in the dialog box, which
specify features of the new object.

The Default buffer defines default data for each type of object
that can be created and edited.  When the Dialog Editor starts,
this buffer is loaded from the History file, if it exists; other-
wise, it is set to built-in default values (shown in the sections
describing each edit dialog).  When the Dialog Editor exits, the
Default buffer is stored in the History file.

The Paste buffer holds temporary data for each type of object 
that can be created and edited.  When the Dialog Editor starts, 
this Paste buffer is copied from the Default buffer after the 
Default buffer is initialized.  The Paste buffer is not saved 
when the Dialog Editor exits.  The Paste buffer is used to copy 
object specifications (except for size and position) from one 
dialog to another, or within a dialog.

The 'edit buffer mode' specifies which buffer will be used to 
initialize a 'new object' dialog.  This mode is indicated by the
word 'Default' or 'Paste' shown on the menu bar.  Clicking on the
displayed word toggles the mode.  When the Dialog Editor starts,
the mode is Default.

All 'new object' dialogs provide these four buttons:

        º±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±º
        º±±±  Save  Ü±±  Copy  Ü±±º
        º±±±±ßßßßßßßß±±±ßßßßßßßß±±º buttons included in all

        ÈÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¼

The Save button ends the dialog, saving the dialog data in the
Default buffer, and setting the edit buffer mode to 'Default'.
No object is created.

The Copy button ends the dialog, saving the dialog data in the
Paste buffer, and setting the edit buffer mode to 'Paste'.  No
object is created.

The Cancel button ends the dialog, with no effect (as though the
dialog had not executed).

The Ok button ends the dialog, creating a new object as specified
by the current dialog data.  If secondary objects are specified,
these are also created as specified.

If the new object is a dialog, the trial dialog is positioned 
near the top left of the screen.  This is generally convenient, 
because it can grow downward and to the right as needed, and 
because the 'new object' and 'change object' dialogs are placed 
near the bottom right of the screen, where they generally will
not obscure the trial dialog.  But all dialogs can be dragged to
new positions if desired.

If the 'Center Dialog' option was chosen, the generated code will
generate a centered dialog regardless of the position of the
trial dialog. Otherwise, the trial dialog can be left in the top
left position while it is edited, then dragged to its 'correct'
position before executing the 'Gen code' command.

If the new object is a component of a dialog, the primary object
and any associated secondary objects are inserted near the bottom
right corner of the trial dialog.  You will generally need to
drag the new object to the desired location and adjust its size
(as described in the next section).

'Change Object' Dialogs -----------------------------------------

Except for the 'Change Dialog' dialog, a 'change object' dialog
has two additional buttons as shown below.  For changing general
features (not components) of the trial dialog, see the section
'Editing the Trial Dialog' below.

The Delete button ends the dialog, and deletes the object from
the trial dialog.

The On Top button does the function of the Ok button (described
below), and also moves the object to the top of the Z-order,
equivalent to being the last object to be inserted into the trial
dialog.  Associated secondary object(s) are also moved on top.
The Z-order determines the order of the data fields of the data
record associated with the dialog. Z-order can be examined by
temporarily sliding one object toward another, and observing
which one is in front (on top).

The Save button ends the dialog, saving the dialog data in the
Default buffer, and setting the edit buffer mode to 'Default'.
The object is not changed.

The Copy button ends the dialog, saving the dialog data in the
Paste buffer, and setting the edit buffer mode to 'Paste'.
The object is not changed.

The Cancel button ends the dialog, with no effect (as though the
dialog had not executed).

The Ok button ends the dialog, changing the object as specified
by the current dialog data.  Secondary objects may be created,
changed, or deleted, depending on how the current dialog data
compares to the current state of the trial object.

Dialog Dialogs ==================================================

These dialogs create and change a trial dialog.

Creating a Trial Dialog -----------------------------------------

If a trial dialog with unsaved changes is on the screen when the 
New Dialog command is executed, then before the 'New Dialog' dia- 
log appears, you will be prompted with a message box asking if
you want to save the current dialog.  Click the Yes or No button.

The Dialog Box Title is the title to be shown centered in the top
edge of the dialog window frame.

The Base Name and Type Name determine the names used in the gen-
erated code.  For the default values of 'Test' and 'Dialog', the
generated code includes:

    { TestDialog }

    type
        PTestDialog = ^TTestDialog;
        TTestDialog = object(TDialog)
            constructor Init;
        end;

        PTestData = ^TTestData;
        TTestData = record
            {definition of data field names and types}
        end;

If these values were changed to 'Report' and 'Window', the gener- 
ated code would include:

    { ReportWindow }

    type
        PReportWindow = ^TReportWindow;
        TReportWindow = object(TWindow)
            constructor Init;
        end;

        PReportData = ^TReportData;
        TReportData = record
            {definition of data field names and types}
        end;

The record definition will include data field names and types 
corresponding to component objects of the dialog, in Z order.

Notice that Type Name specifies the name of the ancestor of the 
'trial dialog' object (excluding the 'T' prefix).  Although this 
documentation and the Dialog Editor program uses the name 
'Dialog' throughout, here the type can be changed to Window or 
some other related object type, such as a descendant of TDialog.  
Although the Dialog Editor is oriented to design of dialogs, it
can also to useful for the design of similar objects, even if the
generated code must be modified.

The Options CheckBoxes make these selections:

[X] Gen. Defaults - causes the generated code to include code 
such as:

    const
        ReportDefaults: TReportData = (
            {definition of default data values}
        );

The default data values are taken from the values displayed in 
the trial dialog, which can be changed by the Test Dialog com- 
mand.  This includes a string value for each InputLine, a hexa- 
decimal value for each CheckBoxes and MultiCheckBoxes, and a
decimal value for each RadioButtons.

But ListBox and ParamText components are handled differently, 
because these generally make indirect reference to data.  Gen- 
erally, you will need to modify the generated code to complete 
these data references.  For ListBoxes, the List pointer is set to 
nil, and the Selection value is set to zero.  For ParamText, %s 
fields are set to nil, %x fields to $0, %c fields to $20 (space 
character), and %d fields to 0.

[X] Center Dialog - includes this statement in the Init con- 
structor of the dialog (even though the trial dialog is not shown 
centered):

    Options:= Options or ofCentered;

[X] Ok Button - includes an Ok button in the dialog, which will
generate this code:

    Insert(New(PButton, Init(R, '~O~k', cmOk, bfDefault)));

[X] Cancel Button - includes a Cancel button in the dialog, which
will generate this code:

    Insert(New(PButton, Init(R, 'C~a~ncel', cmCancel,
        bfNormal)));

Editing the Trial Dialog ----------------------------------------

The trial dialog can be moved by pointing to the top edge of the 
dialog with the mouse and dragging.  The trial dialog can be re- 
sized by pointing to the resize (bottom right) corner of the dia- 
log with the mouse and dragging.

Clicking on the close icon in the dialog frame (or pressing the
ESC key) closes the dialog; you will be prompted with a message
box asking if you want to save the dialog if it has unsaved
changes.

The trial dialog has an optional grid background that can help to 
check the spacing, position, and size of component objects.  (See 
example below.)  Double-clicking on the background toggles be- 
tween the grid style and the normal appearance.

Also, some objects, such as labels, can include space that looks 
exactly like a normal background, and thus is not evident except 
when the grid background is shown.  Such space can be important: 
for example, the selectable area of a Label can extend beyond the 
Label text.  (See 'Name' Label in above example.)  The grid back- 
ground is not included in the 'real' dialog created by the gen- 
erated code.

To change other features of the trial dialog, double-click either
side or  the bottom of the dialog frame (not the top edge or the
resize icon).  This action executes this dialog:

This functions like the 'New Dialog' dialog, except that the but- 
ton options (not needed here) are omitted.

(For other operations on the current trial dialog, see the Dialog
commands Save, Gen Code, Picture, and Test.)

Component Dialogs ===============================================

Each component object described next is created by a 'New XXX' 
command, where 'XXX' is the name of the object type, which exe- 
cutes a 'New XXX' dialog with buttons as described in the section
'Creating Objects' above.

Each component object can be moved / resized as described in the
section 'Moving / Resizing Objects' above.

Double-clicking the component object executes a 'Change XXX' dia- 
log like the 'New XXX' dialog, but with two more buttons as de- 
scribed in the section 'Changing / Deleting Objects' above.  
(Also, the word 'New' in the dialog title becomes 'Change'.)

Because the buttons at the bottom of the edit dialogs are the
same in appearance and operation for all component objects, the
following sections will show and explain only the top part of
each dialog.  Default data is shown in each dialog picture.

StaticText Dialog -----------------------------------------------

        º±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±º

The New ParamText dialog generates a ParamText object only if the 
Format and Parameter Names strings are not empty.  The Format 
item is the text string used to initial the ParamText object, and 
used by the ParamText object to format data (using the FormatStr 
procedure) when the dialog is executed.  (See Borland document- 
ation for more details.)  The Parameter Names item is a list of 
names, separated by commas, to be used as field names for the 
associated data record.  (Spaces are permitted after the commas.) 
The number of names determines the number of data parameters; 
this number is used for the last ParamText.Init parameter.

When coding the data record, it is assumed that the order of the 
names corresponds to the order of the '%' codes in the Format 
string (the '%nnn#' code, if present, is not interpreted).  In 
the data record, the following types are used according to the
'%' codes, as follows:

        code    type
        ----    ----------
        %s      : ^string;
        %c      : longint {lo char};
        %d      : longint;
        %x      : longint;

For example, if the Format string is:

        st=%s de=%d ch=%c hx=%x

and the Parameter Names string is:

        str, dec, chr, hex

then the generated code for the data record will include:

        str: ^string;
        dec: longint;
        chr: longint {lo char};
        hex: longint;

and the generated code for the dialog will include:

Insert(New(PParamText, Init(R, 'st=%s de=%d ch=%c hx=%x', 4)));

The comment "lo char" is a reminder that for %c data, only the
low byte of the longint is used, cast as type 'char'.

The trial ParamText does not execute FormatStr to translate data,
(there is no data) but instead simply displays the format string
'as is'.  Be sure to resize the trial ParamText as needed.  (You
will need to enable the grid background to see the allocated
length of the ParamText object.)

The Button Text item specifies the text on the button, with the
~ characters used to indicate highlighted characters (shortcut
keys).  The Command Name item specifies the name of the command
that the button will activate.  The Button Flags CheckBoxes

The Label item specifies an associated Label object, unless an
empty string is specified.

The Data Name item is the name of the associated data field in
the data record type associated with the dialog.

The Max. Line Length is the maximum length of the string that the
InputLine object edits.  (With the default values, the associated
data field is "Name: string[80]".)

The History ID item specifies an associated History icon, with 
the given ID value, at the immediate right of the InputLine.  The 
History ID item is actually a string that may be a constant 
identifier (that your program will define) or a number in the
range of a word.  But an entry of '' or '0' or a string beginning
with a space character specifies no History icon.  The trial
History icon is not movable or resizable, but automatically
follows the movement and resizing of the InputLine.

The Validator RadioButtons can be used to select an optional Val- 
idator object to be linked to the InputLine.  For choices other
than 'None', the generated code initializes one of the following
descendants of TInputLine, defined in the TvInput unit, which
incorporates corresponding standard validators from the Validate
unit, as follows:

        TInputLine descendant       TValidator descendant
        ---------------------       --------------------
        TFilterInputLine            TFilterValidator
        TRangeInputLine             TRangeValidator
        TStringLookupInputLine      TStringLookupValidator
        TPXPictureInputLine         TPXPictureValidator

If any of these are used, the code should include TvInput in its 
'uses' clause.  (Of course, you can use your own custom valid- 
ators; select a similar validator here, then modify the generated
code later.)

The Validation Parameters string is used to specify the param- 
eters used to initialize the chosen validator.  When a validator 
is chosen, a line of help text is displayed below the Validation 
Parameters input line, suggesting the form of the parameters, as 
follows:

    Validator choice        help text for parameters
    ----------------        ------------------------
    None                     (no parameters needed)
    Filter                   ValidChars: TCharSet
    Range                    Min, Max: longint
    StringLookup             S: PStringCollection
    TPXPicture              Pic:String; Fill:Boolean

The Validator Parameters string should be the parameters as sug- 
gested by the help text, as they should appear in the Pascal code 
for initializing the validator.  For more details, see the docu-
mentation for the standard validators.

The RangeValidator includes a Transfer method that converts the 
string to a longint, which is the type of the field in the dia- 
log's data record.  The other validators leave the data in the 
form of a string.

An associated Label is added or deleted by making the label text 
non-empty or empty.  An associated History icon is added or de- 
leted by making the History ID a valid or invalid constant as
described above.  The length of the InputLine is automatically
adjusted when a History icon is added or deleted.

The Label and Data Name items are the same as for InputLine.

The Item Names ListBox is the place to enter the names to be
shown for the CheckBoxes.  Click the 'New' button, or press the
Enter key (the 'New' button is the default) to enter a new item.
This executes the 'New Item' dialog shown next to the 'New Radio-
Buttons' dialog, below.  Enter the name in the 'Item Name' input
line, and click 'Ok' (or press Enter).

New item names are entered at the selected (highlighted) position 
in the ListBox.  To change an item name, select it (click on it, 
or use arrow keys to move the selection), then click the 'Edit' 
button (or press space key).  This executes a 'Change Item' dia- 
log that looks like and works like the 'New Item' dialog.  To
delete an item, change it to an empty string.  (Items that begin
with a space character are also deleted.)

Contrary to Borland documentation, the data field transferred to 
and from a RadioButtons object is a word, not a longint.  (But
the data field in the RadioButtons object is a longint.)

The edit dialogs for RadioButtons, CheckBoxes, and MultiCheck-
Boxes (the Cluster descendants) each have a Item Names ListBox as
described above.  The Save button in these dialogs copies the
Item Names data into a Paste buffer area shared by all three
types, but the other edit dialog data is copied to separate areas
for each type.

The Label and Data Name items are the same as for InputLine.

The Item Names ListBox and the 'Edit' and 'New' buttons are used
as described for RadioButtons.

Contrary to Borland documentation, the data field transferred to
and from a CheckBoxes object is a word, not a longint.  (But the
data field in the CheckBoxes object is a longint.)  This works OK
if the number of check boxes is 16 or less.  If the number of
check boxes exceeds 16, the generated code will declare the data
field as type longint instead of word, and will include the
comment:

        {+ Need to override DataSize +}

This means that you must use a descendant of TCheckBoxes that 
overrides the DataSize function to return SizeOf(longint) in- 
stead of SizeOf(word).

MultiCheckBoxes Dialog ------------------------------------------

The Label and Data Name items are the same as for InputLine.

The Item Names ListBox and the 'Edit' and 'New' buttons are used
as described for RadioButtons.

The State Codes input line provides a string that lists the char- 
acters that represent the states of each MultiCheckBox.  The 
corresponding values are encoded as 0,1,2.. in the order listed, 
but when the real MultiCheckBox is used, the space key (or click- 
ing an item) changes the state of the selected item in the re- 
verse order.

Two other parameters used to initialize the MultiCheckBoxes are
derived from the States string: the number of states (Range) is
the length of the States string; and the number of bits used to
represent each state (item value) is derived from the number of
states.  If the total number of bits needed to encode all item
values exceeds 32 (the number of bits in a longint), a warning
comment is inserted in the generated code such as:

        {+ WARNING: 40 bits needed! +}

The Label item is the same as for InputLine.

A ListBox has two data fields in the data record associated with
the dialog: a pointer to a StringCollection, and an integer index
indicating the currently selected string in the collection.  The
Data Name item specifies the name of the PStringCollection field,
and the Select Name item specifies the name of the selection
index field.

The Number of Columns item specifies the number of columns of the
ListBox.

Notes ===========================================================

These notes are mainly about TurboVision, as may relate to use of
the Dialog Editor.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Contrary to Borland documentation, the data field trans-
ferred to and from a RadioButtons or CheckBoxes object is a word,
not a longint.  (But the data field in the object is a longint.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: The Borland documentation says that TParamText.SetData
"reads DataSize bytes into ParamList from Rec".  This implies
that memory needs to be allocated and assigned to the ParamList
pointer.  Actually, ParamText.SetData executes:

        ParamList:= @Rec;

where Rec is the data record; so that no memory needs to be al-
located (or deallocated) for ParamList.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE on using a ListBox:

An item can be selected by double-clicking it with the mouse, or
moving the highlight with the cursor keys and pressing space.
When an item is selected, the ListBox executes:

    Message(Owner, evBroadcast, cmListItemSelected, @Self);

But to use this feature, you need to override the HandleEvent
method of the Dialog and provide code to respond to the broadcast
command as desired.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

NOTES on names for TCollection methods that operate on items:

Borland's choices of these names are inconsistant and confusing.
The worst is the overriding of TObject.Free for a different
purpose.  The following translation is offered, where the 'ob-
vious' names match the ordinary use of the names free, delete,
dispose, load, and store as used elsewhere in the Turbo Vision
library.

    obvious name    Turbo Vision name
